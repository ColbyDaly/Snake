Snake: 
The object of the game is to use the arrow keys to collide with the “cherry.” When snake collides, it grows by 2 units and the cherry is randomly spawned elsewhere inside the grid. 

The speed of the snake increases as more points are collected.


Known bugs: Automated snake does not handle self collision. Causes game over.
